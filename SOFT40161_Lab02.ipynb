    "## Control Structure with Python in Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "- Welcome to Lab 2! In this session, we will explore one of the core concepts of programming: control structures. These structures allow us to control the flow of execution in a program, making it more flexible and dynamic. By mastering these tools, you'll gain the ability to make decisions within your code, execute tasks repeatedly, and handle different scenarios efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In this lab, we will focus on four essential control structures:\n",
    "    - Sequence: The default mode where code is executed line by line.\n",
    "    - Branching: Using if-else statements to choose different paths based on conditions.\n",
    "    - Conditions: Checking whether certain criteria are met, allowing for complex decision-making.\n",
    "    - Looping: Repeating tasks using for and while loops to handle repetitive tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the lab, we will work through examples with increasing complexity, including nested if statements, multiple for loops, and understanding infinite loops. You'll also have the opportunity to apply your knowledge through hands-on exercises designed to solidify your understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lab, you should feel confident in using control structures to manage how your programs run. These skills will be essential as we move forward to more advanced topics. Let’s get started!"
